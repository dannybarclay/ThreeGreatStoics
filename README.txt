This project is a website informing the viewer about the philosophical school of thought called Stoicism.

There are three sections:
-Introduction
-3 short biographies with book recommendations and quote generators which generate quotes for each stoic
-A contact form which validations the email address to make sure it is entered in an email format

---------------------------------------------------------
There are three javaScript apps:
1. Email verification.
2. Quote Generator.
3. Responsive nav for viewing on mobile devices.
---------------------------------------------------------

There are no special instructions needed for the site, but these are the requirements I am shooting to meet from the list
provided by CodeLouisville:

1. Hamburger menu 
2. Input validation 
3. JS math in the form of random quote
