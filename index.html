				<h2>When and Where Did It Originate?</h2><br><br>
				<p>Stoicism was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium.  
					It was influenced by Socrates and the Cynics, and it engaged in vigorous debates

			<p class="stoic-description">Marcus Aurelius, originally Marcus Annius Verus, was the son of the Spanish Annius Verus, 
				who had received patrician rank from Emperor Vespasian, and Domitia Calvilla or Lucilla. Marcus' father died when he 
				was three months old, at which time his grandfather adopted him. Later, Titus Antoninus Pius adopted Marcus Aurelius 
				at the age of 17 or 18 as part of an agreement he had made with Emperor Hadrian promoting Antoninus Pius to the status 
				of heir.<br><br>

				As Marcus Aurelius was preparing for the Marcommanic War (along the Danube, between Germanic tribes and Rome), a plague 
				broke out killing thousands. The Antonini (Marcus Aurelius and his co-emperor/brother-by adoption) helped with burials 
				expenses. Marcus Aurelius also aided the Romans in time of famine and so is thought of as a particularly benevolent rule.<br><br>

				Marcus Aurelius died in March 180. Before his funeral, he had been declared a god. When his wife, Faustina, had died in 176, 
					Marcus Aurelius asked the Senate to deify her and built her a temple. The gossipy Augustan History says that Faustina had 
					not been a chaste wife and that it was considered a stain on Marcus Aurelius' reputation that he promoted her lovers.<br><br>

					Marcus Aurelius' ashes were put in Hadrian's mausoleum.<br><br>
					
					Marcus Aurelius was succeeded by his biological heir, in contradistinction to the previous four good emperors. Marcus 
					Aurelius' son was Commodus.</p>

					<p class="stoic-description">Lucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 4 BC–AD 65) —also known as Seneca the Younger or simply 
						as Seneca — was born in Corduba, Spain. He was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, and dramatist. He was 
						raised in Rome, where he was trained in rhetoric and philosophy.<br><br>

						Seneca tells us that he was taken to Rome in the "arms" of his aunt (his mother's stepsister) at a young 
						age, probably when he was about five years old. His father resided for much of his life in the city. Seneca 
						was taught the usual subjects of literature, grammar, and rhetoric, as part of the standard education of 
						high-born Romans. While still young he received philosophical training from Attalus the Stoic.<br><br>
						
						After a successful career as a senator and a period of exile in Corsica on a charge of adultery with the 
						princess Julia Livilla, emperor Claudius’s niece, Seneca became first Nero's tutor, then his advisor when 
						the latter became emperor. It was thanks to the influence of Agrippina, Nero's mother, that Seneca was 
						recalled to Rome.<br><br>
						As a writer, Seneca is known for his philosophical works, and for his plays, which are all tragedies. 
						Seneca regards philosophy as a balm for the wounds of life. The destructive passions, especially anger 
						and grief, must be uprooted, although sometimes he offers advice for moderating them according to reason.
						 He discusses the relative merits of the contemplative life and the active life, and he considers it important 
						 to confront one's own mortality and be able to face death.<br><br>

						Seneca was also a dramatist. Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes in his tragedies: it is the 
						uncontrolled passions which generate madness, ruination, and self-destruction. This has a cosmic as well as 
						an ethical aspect, and fate is a powerful, albeit rather oppressive, force.<br><br>
						
						Seneca was forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate 
						Nero. The conspiracy was organized by Gaius Calpurnius Piso in AD 65. The plot reflected the growing 
						discontent among the ruling class of the Roman state with Nero's increasingly despotic leadership. Although 
						it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy, Nero ordered him to kill himself. Seneca followed 
						tradition by severing several veins in order to bleed to death, and his wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to 
						share his fate. Fortunately, she was saved and was spared by the emperor.<br><br>

							<p class="stoic-description">Epictetus, (born AD 55, probably at Hierapolis, Phrygia [now Pamukkale, Turkey]—died 
								c. 135, Nicopolis, Epirus [Greece]), Greek philosopher associated with the Stoics, remembered for the religious 
								tone of his teachings, which commended him to numerous early Christian thinkers.<br><br>

								His original name is not known; epiktētos is the Greek word meaning “acquired.” As a boy he was a slave but managed 
								to attend lectures by the Stoic Musonius Rufus. He later became a freedman and lived his life lame and in ill health. 
								In AD 90 he was expelled from Rome with other philosophers by the emperor Domitian, who was irritated by the favourable 
								reception given by Stoics to opponents of his tyranny. The rest of his life Epictetus spent at Nicopolis.<br><br>
								
								As far as is known, Epictetus wrote nothing. His teachings were transmitted by Arrian, his pupil, in two works: Discourses, 
								of which four books are extant; and the Encheiridion, or Manual, a condensed aphoristic version of the main doctrines. In his 
								teachings Epictetus followed the early rather than the late Stoics, reverting to Socrates and to Diogenes, the philosopher of 
								Cynicism, as historical models of the sage. Primarily interested in ethics, Epictetus described philosophy as learning “how it 
								is possible to employ desire and aversion without hindrance.” True education, he believed, consists in recognizing that there is 
								only one thing that belongs to an individual fully—his will, or purpose. God, acting as a good king and father, has given each 
								being a will that cannot be compelled or thwarted by anything external. Men are not responsible for the ideas that present 
								themselves to their consciousness, though they are wholly responsible for the way in which they use them. “Two maxims,” Epictetus 
								said, “we must ever bear in mind—that apart from the will there is nothing good or bad, and that we must not try to anticipate 
								or to direct events, but merely to accept them with intelligence.” Man must, that is, believe there is a God whose thought 
								directs the universe.<br><br>
								
								As a political theorist, Epictetus saw man as a member of a great system that comprehends both God and men. Each human being 
								is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth, but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, of which the 
								political city is only a poor copy. All men are the sons of God by virtue of their rationality and are kindred in nature 
								with the divinity. Thus, man is capable of learning to administer his city and his life according to the will of God, which 
								is the will of nature. The natural instinct of animated life, to which man also is subject, is self-preservation and 
								self-interest. Yet men are so constituted that the individual cannot secure his own interests unless he contributes to the 
								common welfare. The aim of the philosopher, therefore, is to see the world as a whole, to grow into the mind of God, and to 
								make the will of nature his own.</p>
